This experiment focuses on designing and implementing a Single Page Application (SPA) that dynamically loads content without refreshing the entire webpage.
A Single Page Application is a modern web application that loads a single HTML page initially and updates only specific content sections as users interact with the application.
Unlike traditional multi-page websites, SPAs avoid full page reloads, resulting in faster performance, smoother navigation, and a better user experience.

The main objective of this experiment is to understand client-side rendering, dynamic content loading, and modern frontend architecture.
The application is developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript / React for managing dynamic behavior.
The SPA contains multiple sections such as Home, About, Services, and Contact, which appear as separate pages but operate within a single web page.
Navigation between sections is handled using client-side routing, allowing instant content updates without server reloads.
JavaScript event handlers or React routing logic detect user interactions and dynamically update the Document Object Model (DOM).
The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring proper display across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

This experiment demonstrates key SPA advantages including:
Faster page transitions
Reduced server requests
Improved application responsiveness
Enhanced user engagement
Lower bandwidth consumption
The project provides hands-on experience with:
Dynamic DOM manipulation
Frontend component-based design
Event-driven programming
Responsive UI development
Client-side navigation handling

Real-world SPA examples such as Gmail, Netflix, and Twitter illustrate the relevance and practical use of this approach.
Through this experiment, learners gain a deeper understanding of modern web technologies, performance optimization, and user-focused application design.
Overall, the experiment successfully demonstrates how Single Page Applications improve usability, speed, and interactivity compared to traditional web applications
